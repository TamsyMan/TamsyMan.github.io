                This is my Beowulf reading project! On this website will be some of my favourite moments of Beowulf, including images and translated poetry. Further down the page is my review of the full verse, what I think about the book and, more widely, about Anglo-Saxon England and its fantastic culture.

                    Having arrived in the land of the Danes, Beowulf encounters his first beast - Grendel. He is depicted as a giant, hideous monster, covered in matted, thick fur, but is also left with a vague physical description, leaving the reader to interpret the horrific sight himself, adding to the mystery and the supernatural nature of the beast. Despite the obvious physical disadvantage Beowulf has, he is able to defeat the monster with just his bare hands to allow a 'fair fight'. He is able to tear off its arm and Grendel flees to die in the marshes. This scene shows the great honour that Beowulf exhibits, by letting the monster have a fair fight by only using his hands.

                    After Beowulf has defeated Grendel and celebrated with his comrades, Grendel's mother attacks and kills one of Hrothgar's best men. To gain revenge and kill the last of the beasts (or so he thinks), he jumps into a river to kill her in an underwater lair. Engaging in a fierce battle, Beowulf finds a sword 'forged by giants' and is able to plunge the sword into Grendel's mother and finish her once and for all. Jumping into a river in which he cannot breathe and fighting Grendel's mother in her own lair shows the great bravery and courage that only Beowulf can have.

                    After having returned to his homeland and been king of the Geats for many years, the old Beowulf faces a formidable dragon with his companions and is heavily injured. His allies run away and leave him in his time of need, showing that one cannot truly trust even one's closest companions. Only Wiglaf comes to his side. After killing the dragon with Wiglaf's help, Beowulf is left to die, with only one by his side.

                    Beowulf is given a large funeral, mourning a great king. The memorial to him is placed by the sea of his lands and a fire is burnt to commemorate the loss of a selfless leader. For the last time, the poem repeats the line: 'Þæt wæs god cyning', representing the end to an era and, possibly the end to true greatness.

            <h3 id="review-t"><u>Review</u></h3>
            <p id="review-p">Beowulf is the best piece of poetry that I have ever read. Through a combination of its mythical beasts, its storyline of Nordic warriors and the unknown circumstances around its writing, Beowulf is the perfect Epic poem. <br> <br>
            
                Unlike modern recreations of Nordic stories, Beowulf is a great story from the time. Nothing can compare to a story written as part of the culture. Coming from a classic world of kings and tales of monsters, Beowulf is very different to any other novel I have read and its brilliant writing creates a sense of power that is unrivalled by any other story. Beowulf truly allows a view into an ancient world which cannot otherwise be seen. <br><br>
                
                Being written in a different language further adds another complex and insightful layer to the story. Even after reading the story once, it still feels as though there is more to uncover. Like an iceberg, I have only understood what is above the water and there is still 90% to discover in the depths. Even the most expert historians do not know everything about Beowulf and likely won't for centuries to come, or ever. <br><br>
                
                Reading this book truly feels like being in the ancient past of England and really makes one wonder what a life of verbal story-telling and campfires would be like and if one would prefer it to the modern world of stress and expectations.

            <p id="finishing-p">Thank you for reading this and hopefully it was not too much of a pain to get the website working. Beowulf is a fantastic piece of literature and so deserves the time and effort. I might even read the book again soon just to find out more about its cryptic writing and incredible history.</p>
